1.0 Introduction
================
The purpose in building out these libraries is to help ease the implementation
of the OpenSRS API.  Not only does it give a starting point in developing an
application to allow for quick integration, but also incorporates new
communication markup languages such as JSON and YAML.  This documentation is
provided to augment the already existing API documentation which is available at:
 
	http://opensrs.com/resources/documentation/opensrs_xmlapi.pdf

1.1 Live Beta Demo Environment
------------------------------
A permanent demo environment is available at your view here:

        http://toolkit.ennertia.com
        http://toolkit.ennertia.com/demo/demo1.php
        http://toolkit.ennertia.com/demo/demo2.php
        http://toolkit.ennertia.com/demo/demo3.php

Code is downloadable at:

        http://opensrs.com/docs/apitoolkits/opensrs_php_toolkit_v2.3.tar.gz
		

==============================
2.0 Setting up the connection
==============================
This PHP library currently supports data being passed in JSON and YAML (it is
also being extended to pass data in XML and Array format as well).

The PHP library requires:
	* PHP 5
	* PEAR - http://pear.php.net/
	* mcrypt - http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.mcrypt.php
        * getmypid() enabled

NOTE:  It's best to use the PHP 5.2+ as json_encode and json_decode are standard
on that version and above. If an earlier version of PHP 5 is needed, the php-json
libraries at http://pecl.php.net/package/json will be required.

Why not use the PEAR JSON functions? Well php-json is much faster! There's a great
comparison that was done a couple of years ago at:

    http://gggeek.altervista.org/sw/article_20061113.html
		
NOTE:  While we are using JSON to call the functions, making it more human
readable, the backend processing is still done in XML and thus the speed of the
calls will not be affected within the API layer.

To use the Library, an application will require the following lines:
//The loader is the key in including all of the libraries that are supported in the toolkit
require_once ("opensrs/openSRS_loader.php");

//The callstring specifies the markup to input
$callstring = json_encode($callArray);
//$callstring = Spyc::YAMLDump($callArray); // YAML output only

//The handler processes the input
$osrsHandler = processOpenSRS ("json", $callstring);
//$osrsHandler = processOpenSRS ("yaml", $callstring); // YAML output only

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Generating your API Private Key and whitelisting your IP address
--------------------------------------------------------------------
To properly use the API functionality in this toolkit (and anytime you use the
API), it's necessary to know what your Private Key is as it's the gateway to
communicating to our API servers.  If you are using a live key already, you
can reuse this key for your purposes.  If you generate a new key, there is
some lag time on the servers for proper communications to occur.  Therefore,
it's wise, especially if you're on a live system, to reuse the Private Key
rather than regenerate it.  If you are moving to a new server, it is necessary
to whitelist the IP address and open up the port for API communications to be
successful.

If you do not kave a key, please follow the steps below.  

+----------------------------+
2.1.0 Generating a private key
+----------------------------+
To generate a key, login into the RWI by going to the following address:

    LIVE:  https://rr-n1-tor.opensrs.net/resellers/
    TEST:  https://horizon.opensrs.net/resellers/

*NOTE:  The TEST system is rather different than the LIVE system.  Therefore,
during testing, the results that you receive are VERY different than you would
get on the LIVE system.  Both Personal Names and Domain searching will yield
different results.  

Once authenticated, scroll down to the bottom of the page where the heading
shows "Profile Management".  Here, there is a link called "Generate New
Private Key".  If you are sure you wish to continue, click on the 'OK' button
on the warning window.  This window ensure that you wish to generate a new
key.  On refresh, you will see a key similiar to this structure:

a2e308f4df69c969de9ada09c39bb43d0e4d0a88ce83fd2c0a193328d16e8bf5080ee7e0ef388fd8aa0dfb42d33dcd02d3de321c9af1f06b

This is essentially the authentication key that you'll be using to working
with the API.  It's essential to keep this key to yourself!

+---------------------------------------------+
2.1.1 Whitelisting an IP address for API access
+---------------------------------------------+
Once you've generated your key (as above), you'll also need to whitelist your
IP address.  If this is not done, an error will be received and continuing
with the API will not possible.  To whitelist your IP address, login to either
LIVE or TEST environment in the RWI (like in section 2.1.0).  Scroll down to
the bottom of the screen under the "Profile Management" section, there is a
link called "Add IPs for Script/API Access".  Once you've clicked on that, you
can "Add New Rule" by typing in the subnet for where your application will be
hosted.  A total of 5 addresses can be added by default. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE:  Adding a new IP address can take up to 15 minutes to
propagate into our system.   

------------------------------------
2.2 Setting up the Reseller account
------------------------------------
Firstly, it is required to specify the username and key for the implementation.
In user_test.xml there is:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<config>
        <osrsRegular>
                <osrs_username>reseller_user</osrs_username>
		<osrs_key>a6c405408cf1dcb9dbf03gd13576de1889435ad8b7694a4c002891f11eb53049fa31feb28b883ad015f6d6aa3760a07668ea3c3dca3a2acd</osrs_key>
                <osrs_environment>TEST</osrs_environment>
                <osrs_protocol>XCP</osrs_protocol>
                <osrs_host>horizon.opensrs.net</osrs_host>
                <osrs_port>55000</osrs_port>
                <osrs_sslPort>55443</osrs_sslPort>
                <osrs_baseClassVersion>2.8.0</osrs_baseClassVersion>
                <osrs_version>XML:0.1</osrs_version>
        </osrsRegular>
        <osrsFastLookup>
                <osrs_host>horizon.opensrs.net</osrs_host>
                <osrs_port>51000</osrs_port>
        </osrsFastLookup>
        <osrsEMail>
                <osrs_host>ssl://admin.test.hostedemail.com</osrs_host>
                <osrs_port>4449</osrs_port>
                <osrs_username>mail_user</osrs_username>
                <osrs_password>mail_password</osrs_password>
                <osrs_domain>mail_domain</osrs_password>
		<osrs_portwait>10</osrs_portwait>
        </osrsEMail>
</config>

NOTE:  The environment and hostnames need to be changed to connect to a LIVE
environment for OpenSRS to function in a live scenario.  The host for the LIVE
environment is rr-n1-tor.opensrs.net.  Adding a new "LIVE" account can be done
in a separate file and thus modifying the below active configuration file.

NOTE: The mail_user, mail_password and mail_domain are all elements of a mailbox
that has company level access.

The mailbox would be broken down as:

Mailbox address:  mail_user@mail_domain
Mailbox password: mail_password

The information from that company level admin mailbox would be used in the config.

-------------------------------
2.2 Setting the active account
-------------------------------
Since there are multiple accounts to choose from, the ability to change from one
environment to another becomes easy by adding different XML configurations (see
section 2.1). The configuration files are in the folder:

	opensrs_lib/configurations

The file that needs to be modified is:

        activeConfig.xml

To make a profile "ACTIVE", just change the <file> tag:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<config>
        <file>specified_file.xml</file>
</config>

-----------------------------------------------------------
2.3 Additional Configuration for customized implementations
-----------------------------------------------------------
If there are plans to change the include folder name, additional changes need to
made to the file:

	opensrs/openSRS_config.php

Changes to the OPENSRSURI constant will need to be made as appropriate.  Using
the full path name may be necessary on some servers.

	define ("OPENSRSURI", "/path/to/opensrs/");

Further changes can be made to function folders:

	//Application core configurations.
	define ("OPENSRSCONFINGS", "configurations/");
	define ("OPENSRSDOMAINS", "domains/");
	define ("OPENSRSMAIL", "mail/");
	define ("OPENSRSFASTLOOKUP", "fastlookup/");

NOTE:  It's recommended to keep these folder names constant as upgrades to the
library may cause files to be put into the wrong folder thus possibily affecting
future enhancements.


=====================
3.0 Quick Start Guide
=====================
Additional information below will assist in setting up specific calls made to
the implementation.  However, all of the information is also included in the
testcase/ directory within this tarball.  Examples of calls can be seen and interacted
with by going to index.php on the web server, all the standardized calls have
been documented in a listed variety categorized by the type of functionality.
The test-*.php example, will provide a good idea of how everything fits into the new
implementation.  To get started in 5 minutes or less, after set-up of the connection
string (see section 2.1), all that is required are the following lines of code:

<? 
//The loader is very important here, it loads all of the libraries into the implementation 
require_once ("opensrs/openSRS_loader.php"); 

$callArray = array ( 
        //This is for the function calls, they can be found on the above website 
        "func" => "suggestDomain", 
		//"func" => "premiumDomain",
		//"func" => "lookupDomain",
        "data" => array ( 
                "domain" => "example.com", 
                // These are optional 
                "selected" => ".com;.net", // These are the selected TLDs to search with 
                "alldomains" => ".com;.net;.org;.ca" // These are the TLDs that the implementation
							supports
        ) 
); 

//This specifies what type of markup to output 
$callstring = json_encode($callArray); 
$osrsHandler = processOpenSRS ("json", $callstring); 

// these are optional depending on required output 
//$callstring = Spyc::YAMLDump($callArray); 
//$osrsHandler = processOpenSRS ("yaml", $callstring); 

// This is to print out the results 
echo (" In: ". $callstring ."<br>"); 
echo ("Out: ". $osrsHandler->resultFormated); 
?> 

===============
4.0 General Use
===============

In the openSRS_Loader there is a processOpenSRS function which will take in the
JSON data and run the appropriate function.

	$returnedResult = processOpenSRS($data_type, $call_string)

The returnedResult variable will be an object that has the result in a string using
the specified data type (json or yaml) and in an array.  There is more information
about what is returned from these functions later in this documentation.  The call
string is the JSON or YAML data that is being passed to the library. All examples
will be using JSON call strings from here on out.

The call string is broken into two parts:

func:
* This is where the system will look for what function it to be executed from the library

data
* This is the information that is being passed to the function
* Most times this is formated in a similar way to the XML, which is found in the API documentation.

An example of a call string for looking up the domain "example.com" would be:

Sample code:
{
	"func": "lookupDomain",
	"data": { 
			"domain": "example.com",
			"alldomains": ".com,.net,.org",
			"selected": ".com,.net"
			}
}

Any application will probably use json_encode($array) and json_decode($json)
instead of constructing the raw json calls itself, but this is a good way to see
it broken down to the essentials.

Here is an example of the call string being used:

Sample code:
<?
require_once("./opensrs/openSRS_loader.php");
require_once("./opensrs/spyc.php");

$openSRS_results=processOpensrs("json",'
	{
		"func": "lookupDomain",
		"data": {
			"domain": "example.com",
			"alldomains": ".com;.net;.org",
			"selected": ".com;.net"
		}
	}');
echo $openSRS_results->resultFormated . "\n";
?>

NOTE:  The example above only gives the raw JSON output.

This example shows it all put together with associative arrays:

Sample code:
<?php
require_once("./opensrs/openSRS_loader.php");
require_once("./opensrs/spyc.php");

$callString["func"]="lookupDomain";
$callString["data"]["domain"]="example.com";
$callString["data"]["alldomains"]=".com;.net;.org";
$callString["data"]["selected"]=".com;.net";

$openSRS_results=processOpensrs("json",json_encode($callString));

// Remember to have the "Associative Array" option set to true after passing the json
$result = json_decode($openSRS_results->resultFormated, true);

foreach ($result as $domain_result)
	echo $domain_result['domain'] . " is " . $domain_result['status'] . "\n";

?>

=================
5.0 Returned Data
=================
The processOpensrs function returns a full stdClass object.  This object has four
public variables that contain the returned data

---------------------
5.1 Results Formated
---------------------
resultFormated
* The result formated in the data type that is originally passed to the function
* This only returns the result and no error codes
* This will be referred to as the "condensed" response

resultFullFormated
* The result in the same data type as resultFormated
* FullFormated returns the result in the format of the XML returned from OpenSRS,
including error codes and details
* This will be referred to as the "full" response

resultRaw
* The result in an associative array instead of the data type originally passed
to the function
* Does not include any error messages, just the essentials of the result

resultFullRaw
* The result in an associative array
* Includes error messages and full data from the OpenSRS system in the format
of the XML returned from OpenSRS

In the Full Raw and Full Formated results there are the following:

	"_OPS_version"
	"protocol"
	"response_text"
	"action"
	"response_code"
	"is_success"
	"attributes"

NOTE: The attributes object will differ from function to function

The application can check is_success and response_code for any trouble with the
request and output details from response_text.  The only exception is the Fast
Lookup, as it does not go through the XML API. 

Call the processOpensrs function:

	$resultObject = processOpensrs($dataType, $callString);

Then reference the result that is easiest to use:

	echo $resultObject->resultRaw["domain"] . "is" . $resultObject->resultRaw["status"];

So why not use the Raw result all of the time and forget about the JSON results?
* The application may need to pass this information to another system and JSON
is great for transmitting data
* The JSON data can be plugged directly into any javascript or AJAX app using
"eval" or, to be more secure, using a JSON parser - http://json.org/

Here is an AJAX example that will see if the passed string has matching domains
in com/net/org/info/biz and output it to an HTML element with the ID "output".
Once the application gets the JSON response back it evaluates the JSON and will
have an object that can be use easily.

Sample AJAX example:

        function domainLookup(name) {
            var jsonResponse = {} ;
            var url="lookupGTLDDomain.php?domain=" + name ;
            var http_request

            if (window.XMLHttpRequest) {
                // code for IE7+, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari
                http_request=new XMLHttpRequest();
            } else if (window.ActiveXObject) {
                // code for IE6, IE5
                http_request=new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
            } else {
                alert("Your browser does not support XMLHTTP!");
            }

            http_request.open( "GET", url, true );
            http_request.send(null);

            http_request.onreadystatechange = function () {

				if (http_request.readyState == 4 && http_request.status == 200) {

					jsonResponse=eval("(" + http_request.responseText + ")");

					document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = "";

					for (var i=0;i < jsonResponse.attributes.lookup.count; i=i+1) {
						document.getElementById("output").innerHTML +=jsonResponse.attributes.lookup.items[i].domain + " is " +jsonResponse.attributes.lookup.items[i].status + "<br />";
					}
				}
			}
		}

===============
6.0 Errors
===============

Errors will happen in two different ways:

===============
6.1 Toolkit Errors
===============
These errors are generated before the toolkit is able to contact the OpenSRS API.
The errors are produced as PHP warnings or notices which would need to be captured.

To capture and deal with these PHP warnings and notices use set_error_handler:
    http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.set-error-handler.php

This will set up a function to process the errors and either log them
or display a custom error to the user.

Error types:

Incomplete config file
* Required information is missing in the config file.  The error will include
what parameter is missing.

Unable to establish socket
* Cannot create a network socket, probably due to network config error.

Authentication Error
* Unable to authenticate with OpenSRS API, check to make sure that the private
key and reseller username are correct

Reseller username or osrs_key is incorrect, please check the config file.
* Same as above

Please check the osrs_key value in the config file, it contains a non hexidecimal character.
* The OpenSRS private key only contains hex characters.  If the config file has
a key that contains non hex characters during a CBC connection, this error will appear.

Read buffer is empty.  Please make sure IP is whitelisted in RWI and check the osrs_key in the config file.
* The OpenSRS system did not return any information.  If the application is using
SSL to connect then there may be a network issue where the data cannot be read.
Under a CBC connection then it is likely that the osrs_key or reseller username is
incorrect. This is also caused by not having the machine IP whitelisted for the API.
Please see section 2.1.1 for information on how to whitelist an IP.

UNEXPECTED READ: Unable to parse HTTP response code.
* Response was not provided in HTTP 1.1 format.  Usually this is caused by the
same reasons as above.

UNEXPECTED READ: Error reading HTTP header.
* Could not read the HTTP header at all, possibly due to dropped connection during
return.

No Content-Length header returned.
* Content length header was blank.  Usually this is due to using a CBC connection
and having an incorrect key or username.  This could also happen if the IP address
of the machine is not whitelisted in OpenSRS.  See section 2.1.1 for information
on whitelisting an IP.
* This will be the most common case of this error

UNEXPECTED READ: No Content-Length.
* Generated by an unexpected read of the content length header.
* Most likely caused by the same issues as the above error, or could be an issue
with the header being corrupted.

UNEXPECTED ERROR: No Content-Length header provided!
* Same causes as above
* Generated when the Content-Lengt should always be provided

UNEXPECTED READ: No CRLF
* No carriage return provided after the header, possibly corrupted information
due to a dropped connection.

Unable to find library directory DIRECTORY,
* Caused usually by an incorrect path in openSRS_config.php.
* Double check all paths in that file to make sure they are correct.
* Directory that is affected will be listed in the error instead of DIRECTORY.

Unable to find library file FILE,
* Same as above, but for a specific library file.
* Filename will be listed in the error instead of FILE.

Unable to find the function passed.
* The Toolkit could not find the function that was passed in the call string.
This could be caused by a misspelling of the function or the configuration paths
are not set correctly.  Check the spelling of the function against the list in
Section 8 of this document and check the paths in openSRS_config.php.

PARAMETER not defined
* This is the most common error.
* Caused by the required parameters not being passed through to the function.
Please check the OpenSRS API documentation to see what is required for each
function.  The page numbers for each function are listed in Section 8 of this
document

Incorrect call
* At least one required parameter was not passed, the call will not be made to
the OpenSRS API.  There will be at least one not defined error before this error.

unknown cipher
* The toolkit only supports CBC connections encrypted with:
DES
BLOWFISH
BLOWFISH-COMPAT
* This will not display if connecting via SSL.

mcrypt_generic_init failed
* Check installation of the mycrypt package, could be corrupted

no initialization vector
* Problem with the CBC connection
* IV was not returned to the toolkit in the response header, could be caused by
a corrupted returned messge.
* This will not display if connecting via SSL.

Mail System Write Error
* The toolkit was unable to write to the server specified, please check
that the mail server name is correct in the config and that the network will
allow sending data to that server.

===============
6.2 OpenSRS Errors
===============

If the error happened on the OpenSRS API side, information will be passed back
in the returned object.

If the command was successful then resultRaw['is_success'] on the returned object will be set
to '1'.  If there is an error then it will be set to 0. The exact error code is
avaliable under resultRaw['response_code'] and the full error text under
resultRaw['response_text']. The response codes from the OpenSRS API are listed
in the API documentation at:

    http://opensrs.com/docs/opensrs_xmlapi.pdf

The response codes from the Mail APP are listed in the documentation at:

    http://opensrs.com/docs/OpenSRS_APP_Dev_Guide.pdf

Example:

$openSRS_results=processOpensrs("json",json_encode($callString));

if ($openSRS_result->resultFullRaw['is_success']=="0"){
    echo "There was an OpenSRS error.  The error code is: ";
    echo $openSRS_results->resultFullRaw['response_code'];
    echo " The error text is: ";
    echo $openSRS_results->resultFullRaw['response_text'] . "\n";
} else {
    echo $openSRS_result->resultFormated;
}

=====================
7.0 Library Functions
=====================

For every type of function, there are matching specific data requirements that
needs to be passed for the function to post the results.  As such, while this
documentation is to assist in augmenting the OpenSRS documentation, all of the
examples are also posted in the testcase/test-*.php files for reference.  Please
 note that not all of the functions are documented in this section.  For further
information on calls, please refer to the XML API documentation:
    http://opensrs.com/resources/documentation/opensrs_xmlapi.pdf

--------------------------------------------------------------
7.1 Lookup Domain (domainLookup, premiumDomain, suggestDomain)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:  To query a domain (domainLookup), suggest alternative names using a
name spinner (suggestDomain) or query a premium domain (premiumDomain)

NOTE:  The functions for domainLookup, premiumDomain and suggestDomain all have
the same format as below.  Please change the "func" name to make the different calls.

* domain - the domain to query
* alldomains - all of the tld(s) this application supports (semi-colon separated) [OPTIONAL]
* selected - the tld(s) to obtain results for (best for integration with multiple
selection checkboxes) [OPTIONAL]

Sample JSON call:
{
   "func": "lookupDomain",
   "data": {
            "domain": "example.net",
            "alldomains": ".com;.net;.org",
            "selected": ".com;.net"
           }
}

Returned Data:
"_OPS_version":"0.9",
"protocol":"XCP",
"response_text":"Command completed successfully",
"action":"REPLY",
"response_code":"200",
"is_success":"1"
"attributes":{

"lookup":{

     "count":"2",
     "response_text":"",
     "response_code":"0",
     "is_success":"1",

     "items":[
       {
         "domain":"example.com",
         "status":"available"
       },
       {
         "domain":"example.net",
         "status":"available"
       }
     ]
   }
},

In the condensed version it returns the items in an array:

[
  {
  "domain":"example.com",
  "status":"available"
  },
  {
  "domain":"example.net",
  "status":"available"
  }
]

---------------
7.2 Fast Lookup
---------------
Purpose:  To open a socket and lookup the availability of domains

* domain - the domain to query
* alldomains - all of the tld(s) the application supports (semi-colon separated) [OPTIONAL]
* selected - the tlds(s) to query for (best for integration with multiple selection
checkboxes) [OPTIONAL]

8.1 - Domain Function list and corresponding Action and Object in OpenSRS XML API
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PHP Function Name			XML Action				XML Object		XML Doc Page	PDF Page

premiumDomain				NAME_SUGGEST				DOMAIN			117				132
allinoneDomain				NAME_SUGGEST				DOMAIN			117				132
suggestDomain				NAME_SUGGEST				DOMAIN			117				132

NOTE:	There is a difference between how NAME_SUGGEST is used by each function
above.  The function premiumDomain will only run NAME_SUGGEST for Premium domain
suggestions.  The suggestDomain function will only run NAME_SUGGEST for name
suggestions.  Finally, allinoneDomain will run NAME_SUGGEST for a TLD lookup,
name suggestions and premium domains all at the same time.
