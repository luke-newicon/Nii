/**
 * Uploads should all pass through an app level upload manager. like this one :-)
 *
 * The problem:
 * File storage policies evolve as the site grows.
 * Often many different modules in an application want to store and upload files.
 * Changing file storage policy becomes difficult to maintain as you have to specify the new
 * file storage rules in each part of the application that involves uploading files.
 * Thus increase risk of bugs and broken functionality. Makes successfully upadting files storage
 * rules a very expensive and problematic task.
 *
 * The solution:
 * Standardise the method by which the application stores and retrives files and ecapsulate the
 * functionality. Like this class!
 *
 *
 * HOW TO USE ME!
 * There are 3 reassons you will need this function:
 *
 * 1) Adding a file uploaded to the system. :doesnt make much sense (know what you mean though)
 *
 * TODO: matt code examples?
 *
 * 2) Creating a new file based on binary or text etc in the system. For example recieving the base_64 encoded 
 * text for an email attachment, you want to create a file from the encoding. Call fileManager->addfile('myEmailAttach','EDV!EÂ£FD(file contents)_ejhfuw3342')
 *
 * 3) Retrieving information for one or more files. (information?)
